# Admin-Dashboard-Fullstack-MERN

### Overview
* The MERN Stack Admin Dashboard is an application that is designed to offer a responsive user-friendly interface for viewing data, leveraging the MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack technology, Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit, and Redux Toolkit Query.
* Admin can visualize data through pie and line charts, as well as choropleth maps.
* The app uses the MongoDB aggregate calls for reducing the query complexity and also offers server pagination, front-end pagination, sorting and filtering options for easy navigation and analysis of large data sets.
* Line charts with date pickers enable admin to select the data within the desired period of time for better insights, such as viewing total sale and unit statistics for a specific year, and tracking other key metrics such as transactions and user data.
* The dashboard provides a dark and light mode theming feature that allows users to customize their experience based on their personal preferences.
* With its advanced features and intuitive interface, the MERN Stack Admin Dashboard is an excellent tool for businesses and organizations that rely on data to make critical decisions.
