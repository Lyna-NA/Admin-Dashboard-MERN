### Overview
The MERN Stack Admin Dashboard is an application that is designed to offer an intuitive interface for viewing data in a user-friendly interface. It utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack technology, along with Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit, and Redux Toolkit Query.

The dashboard provides a range of useful features, such as switching between a dark and light mode, choropleth maps, and pie and line charts, allowing users to easily visualize data. Additionally, the app offers front-end pagination and server pagination, applying the aggregate calls for reducing the query complexity as well as sorting and filtering options, making it easy to navigate and analyze large data sets.

The app is hosted on Render Cloud. With its intuitive interface and powerful features, the MERN Stack Admin Dashboard is an excellent tool for businesses and organizations that rely on data to make informed decisions.
